## Task 7: Hangman Game
Hangman Game [using python 3.12.5]
Choose a word: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words.
Display blanks: Display a series of dashes, representing each letter of the word to be guessed.
Guess a letter: Prompt the player to guess a letter. Validate the input (if it is not a single letter, or if it isnâ€™t a letter.)
Check the guess: Check if the guessed letter is in the word. If it is, reveal the letter in its correct position(s) in the blanks. If not, decrease the number of remaining attempts.
Repeat: Repeat steps 3-4 until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
End game: If the player guesses the word correctly within the allowed attempts, congratulate them. Otherwise, reveal the word and inform them that they have lost.
